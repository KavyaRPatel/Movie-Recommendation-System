Recommendation systems having been much present right now, there are so many approaches to make and improve they.<br>
We can find they in online shops, music streaming and video streaming services.<br>
In this Kernel, I make an EDA on [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) and got the data used for movie ratings to build a Recommendation System with Alternating Least Square (ALS), with it, it will be possible make a user based system or a item based system.<br>
<br>
For this job, I will work with Pandas Dataframes, visualizations with Altair, printable text with BeautifulText and PySpark for ALS.<br>
This Kernel is inspired by the great work made by these guys:
* @tombresee for made this awesome [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/tombresee/next-gen-eda) with great use of HTML.
* @artgor with his great kernels using Altair for Data Visualization, [here's an example](https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/dota-eda-fe-and-models)
* @vchulski for made this [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/vchulski/tutorial-collaborative-filtering-with-pyspark) that explain so good how to use ALS with PySpark.

Alright, let's start installing all nedeed modules and imports, you can in the buttons to see the code or output.
