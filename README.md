# **Introduction:**

Recommendation systems having been much present right now, there are so many approaches to make and improve they.<br>
We can find they in online shops, music streaming and video streaming services.<br>
Dataset used: [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) <br>
<br>
Technologies used: Pandas Dataframes, visualizations with Altair, PySpark for ALS.<br>
<br>
The other datasets will be used for Exploratory Data Analysis.

# **Data Analysis:**

* Rating Frequency.

* Analysis of most rated movies.

* World cloud with most common words.

# **Modeling:**
 
* Importing libraries from Pyspark.

* Creating schema with fields "userID", "movieID", "rating", "timestamp".

* Splitting data into taining and testing.

* Model fitting and evaluating MAE.

* Generate user based recommendation system.

* Generate item based recommendation system.  

# **Final Results:**
