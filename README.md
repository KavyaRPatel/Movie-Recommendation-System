<div class="h2"><center>Introduction</center></div>


Recommendation systems having been much present right now, there are so many approaches to make and improve they.<br>
We can find they in online shops, music streaming and video streaming services.<br>
In this Kernel, We made an EDA on [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) and got the data used for movie ratings to build a Recommendation System with Alternating Least Square (ALS), with it, it will be possible make a user based system or a item based system.<br>
<br>
For this job, We will work with Pandas Dataframes, visualizations with Altair, printable text with BeautifulText and PySpark for ALS.<br>
